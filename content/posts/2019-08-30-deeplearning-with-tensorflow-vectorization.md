Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai Coursera course starts with talking about how using vectorized operations instead of for loops can drastically improve the performance of machine learning and deep learning computations. The course talks about implementing functions such as sigmoid, softmax and more using Numpy. In this series, we'll go through implementing the entire deeplearning.ai using tensorflow 2.0. This post talks about implementing vector operations using the tensorflow framework.
