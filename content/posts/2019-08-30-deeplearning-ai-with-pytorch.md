description: "Jekyll introduced me to the world of static site generators. The developer experience of pushing updates to your GitHub repo and seeing the updates reflect on the Github pages was quite satisfying. No build step required. While over the time, I have tried several other static site generators such as Hugo and Hexo, the one that has won my heart over is Gatsby."
