Co-Author of this paper. Using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to identify various street features such as Crosswalks, curb cuts, walk signals and, bike paths. This project tracks 500 participants and measures their physical activity and tries to correlate it with the presence or absence of street features.

**Tech Used**
- Languages: Python
- Frameworks: Tensorflow, Tensorflow Object Detection
- Tools: Google Colab, Google Cloud AI-Platform

## Question Answering dataset & model

ðŸ”’Source

We compiled an NLP(Natural Language Processing) question answering dataset which has for each question, an image, a paragraph, and four options with the correct answer to that question. Also, we worked on creating an NLP model that successfully predicts the answer to that question using the image, the paragraph, the question, and the four options. Part of a paper that's still in works.
