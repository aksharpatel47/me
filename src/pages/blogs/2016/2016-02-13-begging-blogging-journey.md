I love reading blogs. It's a great way to learn from experts in different fields and to get to know their unique viewpoints. I always wanted to blog. I even started to blog a couple of times in the past but abandoned the blogs as I didn't think it would be worth the time and that I didn't consider myself an expert.

Over the last couple of years, I have learned that it is necessary to invest in yourself to advance in this ever-changing field of software development (Javascript Fatigue Anyone?). I have regularly been learning from Coursera, Udacity, Pluralsight, and Egghead. These sites have been a great resource to learn Javascript, Typescript, React, Node.js and Web development in general.

My current job required me to learn Swift and iOS development. I liked Swift from the get-go due to its similarity to Typescript. So, after finishing introductory tutorials on Pluralsight, I enrolled in iOS Developer Nanodegree at Udacity. The instructors encouraged learning by googling problems and blogging about it. A lot of developers I follow on Twitter also recommend blogging as a way to grow. It is not necessary to be an expert in the field to write a blog post.

Hence, this is my fresh start at blogging. Third time's a charm. Please feel free to point out my mistakes. I hope my blog helps you out in any way possible.

Thank you for reading this and wish me luck.
